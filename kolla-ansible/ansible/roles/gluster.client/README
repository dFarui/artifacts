This role is specifically created to mount glusterfs volumes on CEE LCM nodes.
It is not intended to be a generic role to cover various configuration options of glusterfs.
The current implementation is based on the following assumptions:
 - The volumes are mounted on hosts that are also act as glusterfs cluster members
 - Although the role allows specifying server to mount the volume from, the default setting is to mount from localhost

The role uses the following variables:
  - gluster_mounts
      This variable is a dictinary. The keys of the dictionary are name identifiers of the volumes. The volume name must
      be a valid glusterfs volume name
      The values are dictionaries, the possible keys in the sub dictionaries are:
         mountpoint:   The mount point the volume is mounted at

      Example:
         gluster_mounts:
           infra:
             mountpoint: /mnt
