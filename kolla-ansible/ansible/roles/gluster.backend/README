This role is specifically created to configure glusterfs cluster on CEE LCM nodes.
It is not intended to be a generic role to cover various configuration options of glusterfs.
The current implementation is based on the following assumptions:
 - All cluster nodes are configured with the same type and number of storage devices
      That is, the storage devices intended for glusterfs are assigned with the same device name
      in each node. The devices with the same name serves exactly the same purpose in each node.
 - All glusterfs volumes are replicated volumes, the replica count equals to the number of nodes
 - Each volume uses exacly one brick in each node

The role uses the following variables:

  - gluster_interface
      The interface intended to use for glusterfs data plane traffic. This parameter is configurable
      per host.
      Example:
         gluster_interface: eth1

  - gluster_address_family
      This is a string parameter, the possible values are 'ipv4' and 'ipv6'
      Example:
         gluster_address_family: 'ipv4'

  - gluster_bricks
      This variable is a dictinary. The keys of the dictionary are name identifiers of the bricks
      The values for the brick names are also dictionaries. Keys in the sub directories are
         blockdev:     pointing to the block device the brick is created on
         filesystem:   the filesystem that the brick uses
         mountpoint:   the base directory where the brick is mounted. The actual mount poing is <base>/<brick_name>

      Example:
         gluster_bricks:
           brick1:
             blockdev: /dev/sdb
             filesystem: xfs
             mountpoint: /gluster_bricks

      This example results in an xfs file system created on /dev/sdb, and the filesystem is mounted at
      /gluster_bricks/brick1

  - gluster_volumes
      This variable is a dictinary. The keys of the dictionary are name identifiers of the volumes
      The values are dictionaries, the possible keys in the sub dictionaries are:
         brick:        The (single) brick that the volume is created on. It must be a valid name used in gluster_bricks

      Example:
         gluster_volumes:
           infra:
             brick: brick1
